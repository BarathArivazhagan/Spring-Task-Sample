Approach used to find the maximum satisfaction index :


Approach :

Sort the list of items starting with least time taken
Find the best combination of time taken/taken`s for all the items starting with least time taken
    
 Example: 
 
consider below as the result of step 1 :

 Item [satisfactionIndex=37336, timeTaken=7]
Item [satisfactionIndex=41595, timeTaken=9]
Item [satisfactionIndex=46043, timeTaken=12]
Item [satisfactionIndex=28636, timeTaken=14]
Item [satisfactionIndex=28550, timeTaken=25]

To find the best combination of time taken/taken`s from step 1 : 

Populate the consolidated table simultaneously with best combination of time taken/taken`s from from step 1 by considering as below:

2.1: For first iteration : consolidated table is pre populated with index of least time taken 

2.2 : For other iterations :  

 Let current Item: next item from step 1
Let  previous Item : previous  item from  step 1

find the nearest item* from list of items with time taken less than current item`s time taken

IF: if time taken for an item is already consumed, find the list of remaining items from step 1 below the time difference and find the maximum satisfaction index of an Item among the remaining items and add its corresponding time taken to the existing combination of time taken`s.

find the time difference = sum of all time taken`s found - current` time taken


IF: time difference < least time taken	CONTINUE step 2.2

Add all the satisfaction index of combination of time taken`s used to find the maximum satisfaction index for the time taken.


IF: current item`s  satisfaction index > total satisfaction index after the sum

THEN : total satisfaction index = current item`s  satisfaction index

Result:

Consolidated table formed with best combination of time taken/taken`s from from step 1 using above process will look like below :

Item [satisfactionIndex=37336, timeTaken=7, timeTakenCombos=[7]]
Item [ satisfactionIndex=41595, timeTaken=9, timeTakenCombos=[9]]
Item [satisfactionIndex=46043, timeTaken=12, timeTakenCombos=[12]]
Item [satisfactionIndex=46043, timeTaken=14, timeTakenCombos=[12]]
Item [satisfactionIndex=87638, timeTaken=25, timeTakenCombos=[12, 9]]
Item [satisfactionIndex=153610, timeTaken=43, timeTakenCombos=[12, 9,7,14]]


3. Find the best nearest item from step 2 and continue step 2.2 until minutes entered is less than least time taken from the list of items


Note: best nearest item is the item which is having highest satisfaction index with least time taken from the list of items

Maximum satisfaction index  obtained for 10000 minutes :

Total Minutes 10000 Total satisfaction index 2182384
